## Problem Statement

### Propulsion Plants Decay Evaluation(propulsion.csv)
- Develop a model, to predict the column
 -‘GT Compressor decay state coefficient’ minimizing ‘rmse’ loss function.
- You are encouraged to try out different techniques from ML/DL and share comparative results.
- Please refrain from using very complex architectures in case of deploying deep learning algorithms.
- Use of proper feature selection process and hyperparameter tuning (if required) is necessary.
- Properly commenting the code is required
- We will use a test set to check the model performance
